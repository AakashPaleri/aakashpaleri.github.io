    <h3>Introduction to the toolbox</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">An ethics-by-design toolbox in synthetic biology (SynBio) can help tackle the complex
ethical, social, and environmental challenges inherent to the field. Traditional ethical
assessments such as Ethical, Legal and Social Implications (ELSI) and Resposible Research and Innovation (RRI) often occur too late in the research process, where ethics is seen as a separate endeavour. Whereas an ethics-by-design
approach embeds ethical reflection from the outset, enabling scientists to anticipate and
navigate value-laden decisions as they arise. Given that SynBio involves the re-engineering
of living systems, it raises profound questions about human intervention in nature,
biosafety, biodiversity, and justice, which require more than regulatory oversight alone.
Moreover, the toolbox can aid in addressing the persistent gap between scientific and
ethical disciplines by offering practical frameworks that foster collaboration and mutual
understanding. It is particularly valuable in supporting early-career researchers, who often
lack formal training in ethics, by providing accessible tools for ethical engagement. Its
flexibility allows adaptation to varied research contexts, accommodating differences in
institutional cultures, geographic locations, and individual moral commitments. Importantly,
such a toolbox also fills the gaps in existing governance structures by offering process-based
tools, such as stakeholder mapping and scenario planning, that promote reflective and
responsible innovation. As SynBio continues to evolve rapidly, an ethics-by-design toolbox
ensures that ethical considerations keep pace, promoting research that is not only
scientifically sound but also socially responsive, environmentally just, and ethically
grounded.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The toolbox is intended to contribute to ongoing ethical debates in SynBio by foregrounding
often-overlooked issues, particularly those related to environmental sustainability and
livelihood justice. This toolbox also provides access to an in-house developed Standard
Operating Procedure (SOP) that serves as a reference guide to support productive
collaborations between ethicists and researchers. This handbook is designed to be
descriptive and informative, functioning as a practical resource to facilitate meaningful
integration of ethical reflection into scientific research. It is especially valuable for early-
career researchers engaged in projects at the intersection of science and ethics.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The toolbox is thus conceived as a collection of practical tools and resources that enable
ethical research practices. Specifically, it provides a structured, step-by-step guide that can
support users with the identification and navigation of potential ethical challenges inherent
to their work. By offering anticipatory guidance, the toolbox helps mitigate ethical concerns
that might otherwise be overlooked in the early stages of research. Given the rapid pace of
scientific advancement and the absence of widely adopted normative frameworks in
emerging fields like SynBio, such a resource is especially urgent. Additionally, the toolbox
outlines strategies for fostering sustainable laboratory practices, further extending its
relevance to both ethical and environmental dimensions of scientific work.</p>
