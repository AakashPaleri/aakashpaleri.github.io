    <h2>Self-Analysis Questionnaire</h2>
    <p>The Self-Analysis Questionnaire is intended to help you pre-emptively analyse the ethical values at stake in your research and adapt your research design accordingly</p>
    <p>Having gained an insight into a few ethical principles, key stakeholders and their role, and gone through some illustrative case studies, this questionnaire is designed to support the application of these insights to your own research setting. It consists of a series of steps that involve both individual reflection and collaborative discussion. The questions are intended to help you critically analyze potential ethical dilemmas that may arise in your research and to explore possible solutions and alternative approaches. You are encouraged to expand, adapt, or modify the questions as needed to align with the specifics of your research design.</p>

    <p><b>NOTE:</b> Itâ€™s important to remember that this questionnaire will not provide any definitive answers; this process is a form of ethical deliberation, where you reflect on and weigh different principles.</p>
